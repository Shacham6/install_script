# Install Script

WIP installation script for my machine, be it a mac machine or a linux one. This is for me.

Further instructions will be later.

This is public just so I'll be able to clone it without configuring anything, not because I care for anyone to contribute. No one ever will. I guarantee it.

If you are not me and you are seeing this - go away.

## Usage

Run the following. I hope that it'll work.

```shell
> curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Shacham6/install_script/refs/heads/main/install_script.sh | sh
```
